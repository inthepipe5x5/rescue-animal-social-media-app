# Far Fetched - Rescue Animals App

## Overview

Far Fetched is a web application designed to address the challenges faced by local animal rescues in gaining visibility and efficiently managing their operations. The platform connects interested consumers with rescue organizations and streamlines the adoption, fostering, and volunteering processes. Far Fetched aims to improve the efficiency of rescue operations while providing a personalized experience for users.

## The Problem

In many cities, local animal rescues struggle to gain visibility and resources due to limited online presence and technical resources. As a result, animals often wait longer to be rescued, and rescue organizations face challenges in managing applicant processing efficiently. The lack of standardized application processes further complicates the situation.

## My Solution

Far Fetched offers an online platform that connects users with animal rescues based on their preferences and needs. The app features a standardized onboarding process for both users and rescue organizations, personalized recommendations based on user data, and customizable search options. Users can save their favorite agencies and track updates, while rescue organizations can efficiently filter and manage applicant profiles.

## Proposed App Features

- **Standardized Onboarding Process:** Streamlined registration process quantifies user lifestyle factors, personal values, and animal handling experience.
- **Tailored Recommendations:** Personalized explore page matches users to agencies based on their profile data and preferences collected during onboarding.
- **Customizable Search Options:** Users can filter search results based on location, type of animal, age, and more. Agencies can also filter user profiles based on specific criteria.
- **Save and Track Favorite Agencies:** Users can save their favorite animal rescues and receive updates on new rescues listed.
- **Potential Future Features:** Personalized events advertising, user reviews, resource center, and built-in application feature for fostering or adopting rescue animals.
